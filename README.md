This script was requested by TheRedstoneScientist.

Please not that this script has only been tested on a mac, it does work on Linux. 
I do not know if this script works on Windows (windows users please try it and tell me).

#How to use it
First of all in your terminal type chmod a+x, do not press enter and drag and drop the script to your terminal, now press enter.
Launch the script by double clicking it or opening it from the terminal.
The script will ask you wether you want to download from a video or a playlist


If you want only one video:
  type "video"
  then copy the link to the video and paste it in the terminal
  The script will then download the thumnbail in the same directory it's in.
  
If you want to download the thumbnail of all the videos in a playlist:
  type "playlist"
  copy the link of the playlist (note do not copy the link of a video that's in the playlist, to be sure that it's the right link, make sure the link starts like that: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=)
  Paste it in the terminal, you will see the id of the video that's currently being downloaded and the progress (It should look like that: Downloading *link* [4/10]).

When the script returns "Successfully downloaded thumbnail(s)!" then you are done.
